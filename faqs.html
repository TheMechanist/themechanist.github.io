        <div class="faq">
          <h2>Do you accept credit cards&#63;</h2>
          <p>Yes&#33; We accept all major credit cards.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
          <h2>Do you offer a payment plan&#63;</h2>
          <p>Yes, we do offer affordable payment plans.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
          <h2>What is a &quot;Personal Injury&quot; case&#63;</h2>
          <p>Any case that involves you being injured due to the fault &#40;negligence&#41; of someone else. Is considered a personal injury case. These cases include -among others- car wrecks, slip and falls, dog bites, tractor trailer wrecks and faulty &#40;defective&#41; products. If you aren’t sure if your case is a personal injury case, contact us and we’ll tell you. It costs you nothing to inquire.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
          <h2>How do I know if I need to hire a lawyer</h2>
          <p>Because every case is different, it is not possible to give you a quick test to determine if you need a lawyer. Talking to us initially costs nothing. We believe that in order to tell you whether in our opinion you will benefit from having us work on your case, you need to talk to us about the specifics of your case.</p>
          <p>The best test for deciding whether or not if you need an attorney is when it is someone is telling you that you don't need one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
          <h2>Do I have a case&#63;</h2>
          <p>We can't tell you that until we talk to you. While we may decide that your case is not one we can help you with, we think it is necessary to talk to you in order to make that decision. If in doubt, call. It costs you nothing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
          <h2>Can you guarantee me a certain recovery&#63;</h2>
          <p>No, lawyers cannot guarantee results. We do have many years of experience handling litigation and, once we have the evidence necessary to value your case, we will tell you our opinion about its value. We will answer any questions you have and tell you how we arrived at that value. We always remember that it is your case, not ours, and we want you to be informed.</p>

        <div class="faq">
          <h2>Are there any hidden costs&#63;</h2>
          <p>None at all&#33; All fees are fully disclosed as per attorney agreement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
          <h2>If I call you for a consultation, are you going to charge me&#63;</h2>
          <p>No. All initial consultations are &quot;free&quot;. Of course, everything you tell us is confidential even if you never hire us.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
          <h2>How is a Lawsuit Started&#63;</h2>
          <p>If you have been injured under circumstances in which someone is liable to you, you can begin a lawsuit. A lawsuit is started by filing a Complaint with the Court. As the one bringing the lawsuit, you are the plaintiff. The Complaint is then served upon the defendants, along with a Summons that requires the defendants to respond to the lawsuit in order to avoid a default. Defendants typically turn the Complaint over to their insurance companies, which hire lawyers to defend against the lawsuit. The defendants' lawyers files Answers to the Complaint with the Court and the case proceeds through litigation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
          <h2>How long will it take my case to be resolved&#63;</h2>
          <p>Because every case is different, it's impossible to accurately answer that question up front. We are very thorough in how we handle cases, because you only get one recovery. If your case settles too quickly, and you discover you have additional or more severe problems than you thought, and you've already settled, you cannot go back for more. We make every effort to handle your case as quickly as we can without jeopardizing your recovery.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
          <h2>Should I negotiate with the insurance adjuster&#63; Are they on my side&#63;</h2>
          <p>No - absolutely not! The insurance adjuster is not on your side. He or she is trained to negotiate and they know the law. Also, they are removed from the situation and you are not. You are personally involved, and you need to take yourself out of it. Call for professional help. Call us.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
          <h2>Will my case have to go to court&#63;</h2>
          <p>Contrary to what you hear on television and read in the newspapers about our courts being clogged with personal injury suits, most cases settle. We make a good faith effort to settle cases, but if the other side isn't willing to pay a fair amount on your claim, we will file suit. Even after suit is filed, most cases still settle. If your case has to be tried, we will work with you to make sure you are prepared for that process.</p>
